            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Football is a sport where two teams control and dominate a ball using their feet on a rectangular field, following certain rules to attack and defend against each other. Due to its strong antagonism, varied tactics, and large number of participants, it is known as "the world's first sport."
                The precursor of modern football originated from the ball game "Cuju" in Zizhou (now Zibo City) in ancient China, which was later transmitted to Europe by the Arabs and gradually evolved into modern football. 
                Modern football began in England.
                In 2005, during the closing ceremony of FIFA's centenary celebration, China's Shandong Linzi was officially declared the birthplace of world football.
                "War State Policy" and "Shiji" are the earliest records of Cuju. The former describes Cuju activities more than 2,300 years ago in the territory of the State of Qi (now Zibo city, Shandong Province) during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, while the latter records that Cuju was used to train soldiers and assess their physical fitness ("Cuju, soldiers are also, so training warriors, know the material"). During the Tang and Song dynasties, Cuju was highly popular and became an elegant activity in the imperial court.

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;In football, referees use specific gestures to indicate game conduct and rule enforcement. Here are some common football gestures: Direct free kick: The referee raises one arm sideways with the ball, clearly indicating the direction of the kick. Indirect free kick: The referee raises one arm, palm forward, until the ball is kicked and touched by another player or stops. Goal kick: The referee raises one arm obliquely forward and downward, pointing to the goal area for the goal kick. Corner kick: The referee raises one arm diagonally, pointing to the corner area for the corner kick. Penalty kick: The referee raises one arm forward obliquely downward, pointing to the penalty spot for the penalty kick. Signal to continue play: When the referee decides not to penalize after a foul, they signal to continue play by waving their arms slightly forward. Sending off and issuing a warning to a player: When a player is sent off or warned, the referee shows a red or yellow card respectively, holding the card straight up facing the disciplined player, allowing both on and off the field to see which player is being disciplined. These gestures are designed to ensure smooth gameplay and fairness.</p>

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Striker: The main responsibility of the striker is to disrupt the opposing formation, actively create scoring opportunities, and act as the main scorer. Their position is usually in the opponent's half. Centre forward: A forward who primarily attacks from the center line of the field. Winger: A forward who mainly plays on both sides of the pitch to disrupt the opponent's defense and create scoring opportunities. Shadow Striker: Positioned behind the center, they cooperate with the center's strong attack, increasing the center's attack fault tolerance. Defender: Usually positioned near their own penalty area. Centre-back: Positioned directly in front of the goalkeeper, they face the most intense attacks from the center. Full-back: Positioned on either side of the pitch, they mainly interfere with the attacking line of the opposing wing player, forcing the ball out of bounds or intercepting it on the counter-attack. Sweeper: This position combines the abilities of defenders and midfielders, with a preference for defensive play. Midfielders: Midfielders hold various positions such as attacking midfielder, defensive midfielder, and wide midfielder, mainly organizing attacks and defending against the opposition's attacks. Goalkeeper: Positioned in front of the goal, they are the team's last line of defense, tasked with guarding the goal and initiating attacks with fast and accurate passes when transitioning from defense to attack. They are the only players allowed to handle the ball with their hands within the penalty area, acting as the third center back when contesting high balls in the penalty area, and serving as the backbone of the team's defense and counterattacks.</p>
